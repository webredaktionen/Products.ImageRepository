Current remaining issues:

- Adding a new keyword in the "Edit keywords" tab doesn't save them (they should be saved on the container, so they are available globally)

- Once you have added one filter keyword, you can't add more, only remove.

- Display menu has 'imagerepository_view' as the name for the default IR view

- Should come with a recommendation to disallow global image adding and only allow it inside the image repository.
