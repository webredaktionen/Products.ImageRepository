Image Repository
================

Overview
--------

Image Repository is a centralized BTree-based image repository with
keyword/tag-based browsing and filtering.

Image Repository is a simple folder that can hold thousands of images, and
provides you with a user interface that lets you tag things with keywords
effectively, as well as browse images by keywords (tags).

* Its goal is to provide you with an easy way to have a centralized image
  library with thousands of images categorized by keywords, dates, etc.

* It has special handling that lets you browse the keyword space like it was
  a collection of nested folders. Example: Browse to keyword "Carnivores",
  you will get the available keywords "Cats", "Dogs", and the selection will
  narrow down, applying all the keywords you have selected on your path
  through the keyword space.

* It comes complete with a Kupu "library", meaning you can browse the
  keywords through the Kupu image insertion dialog to make it easy to locate
  images even in a large collection of images.

* It has a tagging interface that lets you tag images with a thumbnail like
  view, and apply keywords to multiple images at once.

* It uses whatever image type you have installed (it does need to be added as
  an addable type and be able to supply thumbnails like the default Plone
  image type, though).
